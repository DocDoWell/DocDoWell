ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DocDoWell
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in owning a comprehensive technical arsenal that will enable me to be an expert on creating distributed, fault tolerant, scalable and secure technological solutions.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything. I really value continuous learning but I'm focusing on: Algorithms And Data Structures, Functional//OOP programming, Microservice Architectures, K8s, Kafka and Vue.js atm.
  âš¡ Fun fact: I'm CKA certified.
